    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>By using waitIist.com, you confirm your acceptance of, and agree to be bound by, these terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2>Agreement to Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>This Agreement takes effect on the date on which you first use the waitIist application.</p>

    <h2>Unlimited Access Software License with Termination Rights</h2>
    <p>The waitIist Software License facilitates the acquisition of waitIist through a single purchase, granting users access to a subdomain that will be available for at least one year. While we strive to provide this subdomain indefinitely, we cannot guarantee that the domain will not be terminated. Therefore, we assure users that the subdomain will remain active for a minimum of one year from the date of purchase. This license entails a straightforward and flexible arrangement, exempting users from recurring fees or subscriptions. However, it is important to acknowledge that the licensor retains the right to terminate the license without conditions or prerequisites. This termination provision enables the licensor to exercise control over software distribution and utilization. Opting for the waitIist Software License enables users to enjoy the benefits of the software while recognizing the licensor's unrestricted termination rights, which provide adaptability and address potential unforeseen circumstances.</p>

    <h2>Service Hosting Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>The service will be hosted by namecheap.com as the domain is registered there. We are not responsible for failures in their systems.</p>

    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>Due to the nature of digital products, the waitIist service cannot be refunded or exchanged once access is granted.</p>

    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>It is not warranted that waitIist will meet your requirements or that its operation will be uninterrupted or error-free. All express and implied warranties or conditions not stated in this Agreement (including without limitation, loss of profits, loss or corruption of data, business interruption or loss of contracts), so far as such exclusion or disclaimer is permitted under the applicable law are excluded and expressly disclaimed. This Agreement does not affect your statutory rights.</p>

    <h2>Warranties and Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>waitIist does not give any warranty, guarantee, or other term as to the quality, fitness for purpose, or otherwise of the software. waitIist shall not be liable to you by reason of any representation (unless fraudulent), or any implied warranty, condition or other term, or any duty at common law, for any loss of profit or any indirect, special or consequential loss, damage, costs, expenses or other claims (whether caused by waitIist's negligence or the negligence of its servants or agents or otherwise) which arise out of or in connection with the provision of any goods or services by waitIist. waitIist shall not be liable or deemed to be in breach of contract by reason of any delay in performing, or failure to perform, any of its obligations if the delay or failure was due to any cause beyond its reasonable control. Notwithstanding contrary clauses in this Agreement, in the event that waitIist is deemed liable to you for breach of this Agreement, you agree that waitIist's liability is limited to the amount actually paid by you for your services or software, which amount is calculated in reliance upon this clause. You hereby release waitIist from any and all obligations, liabilities and claims in excess of this limitation.</p>

    <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>waitIist is not responsible for what the user does with the user-generated content.</p>

    <h2>Price Adjustments</h2>
    <p>As we continue to improve waitIist and expand our offerings, the price may increase. The discount is provided to help customers secure the current price without being surprised by future increases.</p>
